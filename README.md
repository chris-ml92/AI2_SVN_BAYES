Task:
Write a spam filter using discrimitative and generative classifiers.

Dataset:
Use the Spambase dataset which already represents spam/ham messages through a bag-of-words representations through a dictionary of 48 highly discriminative words and 6 characters. The first 54 features correspond to word/symbols frequencies; ignore features 55-57; feature 58 is the class label (1 spam/0 ham).

How can we do so?:
Perform SVM classification using linear, polynomial of degree 2, and RBF kernels over the TF/IDF representation. 
Can you transform the kernels to make use of angular information only (i.e., no length)? Are they still positive definite kernels?
Classify the same data also through a Naive Bayes classifier for continuous inputs, modelling each feature with a Gaussian distribution
